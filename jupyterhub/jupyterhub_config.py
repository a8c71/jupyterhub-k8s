#  The single-user notebook server will never be scheduled by the kernel to use
#  more cpu-cores than this. There is no guarantee that it can access this many
#  cpu-cores.
#  
#  **This is a configuration setting. Your spawner must implement support for the
#  limit to work.** The default spawner, `LocalProcessSpawner`, does **not**
#  implement this support. A custom spawner **must** add support for this setting
#  for it to be enforced.
#  Default: None
# c.Spawner.cpu_limit = None

## Enable debug-logging of the single-user server
#  Default: False
# c.Spawner.debug = False

## The URL the single-user server should start in.
#  
#  `{username}` will be expanded to the user's username
#  
#  Example uses:
#  
#  - You can set `notebook_dir` to `/` and `default_url` to `/tree/home/{username}` to allow people to
#    navigate the whole filesystem from their notebook server, but still start in their home directory.
#  - Start with `/notebooks` instead of `/tree` if `default_url` points to a notebook instead of a directory.
#  - You can set this to `/lab` to have JupyterLab start by default, rather than Jupyter Notebook.
#  Default: ''
# c.Spawner.default_url = ''

## Disable per-user configuration of single-user servers.
#  
#  When starting the user's single-user server, any config file found in the
#  user's $HOME directory will be ignored.
#  
#  Note: a user could circumvent this if the user modifies their Python
#  environment, such as when they have their own conda environments / virtualenvs
#  / containers.
#  Default: False
# c.Spawner.disable_user_config = False

## List of environment variables for the single-user server to inherit from the
#  JupyterHub process.
#  
#  This list is used to ensure that sensitive information in the JupyterHub
#  process's environment (such as `CONFIGPROXY_AUTH_TOKEN`) is not passed to the
#  single-user server's process.
#  Default: ['PATH', 'PYTHONPATH', 'CONDA_ROOT', 'CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV', 'VIRTUAL_ENV', 'LANG', 'LC_ALL', 'JUPYTERHUB_SINGLEUSER_APP']
# c.Spawner.env_keep = ['PATH', 'PYTHONPATH', 'CONDA_ROOT', 'CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV', 'VIRTUAL_ENV', 'LANG', 'LC_ALL', 'JUPYTERHUB_SINGLEUSER_APP']

## Extra environment variables to set for the single-user server's process.
#  
#  Environment variables that end up in the single-user server's process come from 3 sources:
#    - This `environment` configurable
#    - The JupyterHub process' environment variables that are listed in `env_keep`
#    - Variables to establish contact between the single-user notebook and the hub (such as JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN)
#  
#  The `environment` configurable should be set by JupyterHub administrators to
#  add installation specific environment variables. It is a dict where the key is
#  the name of the environment variable, and the value can be a string or a
#  callable. If it is a callable, it will be called with one parameter (the
#  spawner instance), and should return a string fairly quickly (no blocking
#  operations please!).
#  
#  Note that the spawner class' interface is not guaranteed to be exactly same
#  across upgrades, so if you are using the callable take care to verify it
#  continues to work after upgrades!
#  
#  .. versionchanged:: 1.2
#      environment from this configuration has highest priority,
#      allowing override of 'default' env variables,
#      such as JUPYTERHUB_API_URL.
#  Default: {}
# c.Spawner.environment = {}

## Timeout (in seconds) before giving up on a spawned HTTP server
#  
#  Once a server has successfully been spawned, this is the amount of time we
#  wait before assuming that the server is unable to accept connections.
#  Default: 30
# c.Spawner.http_timeout = 30

## The URL the single-user server should connect to the Hub.
#  
#  If the Hub URL set in your JupyterHub config is not reachable from spawned
#  notebooks, you can set differnt URL by this config.
#  
#  Is None if you don't need to change the URL.
#  Default: None
# c.Spawner.hub_connect_url = None

## The IP address (or hostname) the single-user server should listen on.
#  
#  Usually either '127.0.0.1' (default) or '0.0.0.0'.
#  
#  The JupyterHub proxy implementation should be able to send packets to this
#  interface.
#  
#  Subclasses which launch remotely or in containers should override the default
#  to '0.0.0.0'.
#  
#  .. versionchanged:: 2.0
#      Default changed to '127.0.0.1', from ''.
#      In most cases, this does not result in a change in behavior,
#      as '' was interpreted as 'unspecified',
#      which used the subprocesses' own default, itself usually '127.0.0.1'.
#  Default: '127.0.0.1'
# c.Spawner.ip = '127.0.0.1'

## Minimum number of bytes a single-user notebook server is guaranteed to have
#  available.
#  
#  Allows the following suffixes:
#    - K -> Kilobytes
#    - M -> Megabytes
#    - G -> Gigabytes
#    - T -> Terabytes
#  
#  **This is a configuration setting. Your spawner must implement support for the
#  limit to work.** The default spawner, `LocalProcessSpawner`, does **not**
#  implement this support. A custom spawner **must** add support for this setting
#  for it to be enforced.
#  Default: None
# c.Spawner.mem_guarantee = None

## Maximum number of bytes a single-user notebook server is allowed to use.
#  
#  Allows the following suffixes:
#    - K -> Kilobytes
#    - M -> Megabytes
#    - G -> Gigabytes
#    - T -> Terabytes
#  
#  If the single user server tries to allocate more memory than this, it will
#  fail. There is no guarantee that the single-user notebook server will be able
#  to allocate this much memory - only that it can not allocate more than this.
#  
#  **This is a configuration setting. Your spawner must implement support for the
#  limit to work.** The default spawner, `LocalProcessSpawner`, does **not**
#  implement this support. A custom spawner **must** add support for this setting
#  for it to be enforced.
#  Default: None
# c.Spawner.mem_limit = None

## Path to the notebook directory for the single-user server.
#  
#  The user sees a file listing of this directory when the notebook interface is
#  started. The current interface does not easily allow browsing beyond the
#  subdirectories in this directory's tree.
#  
#  `~` will be expanded to the home directory of the user, and {username} will be
#  replaced with the name of the user.
#  
#  Note that this does *not* prevent users from accessing files outside of this
#  path! They can do so with many other means.
#  Default: ''
# c.Spawner.notebook_dir = ''

## Allowed roles for oauth tokens.
#  
#          This sets the maximum and default roles
#          assigned to oauth tokens issued by a single-user server's
#          oauth client (i.e. tokens stored in browsers after authenticating with the server),
#          defining what actions the server can take on behalf of logged-in users.
#  
#          Default is an empty list, meaning minimal permissions to identify users,
#          no actions can be taken on their behalf.
#  Default: traitlets.Undefined
# c.Spawner.oauth_roles = traitlets.Undefined

## An HTML form for options a user can specify on launching their server.
#  
#  The surrounding `<form>` element and the submit button are already provided.
#  
#  For example:
#  
#  .. code:: html
#  
#      Set your key:
#      <input name="key" val="default_key"></input>
#      <br>
#      Choose a letter:
#      <select name="letter" multiple="true">
#        <option value="A">The letter A</option>
#        <option value="B">The letter B</option>
#      </select>
#  
#  The data from this form submission will be passed on to your spawner in
#  `self.user_options`
#  
#  Instead of a form snippet string, this could also be a callable that takes as
#  one parameter the current spawner instance and returns a string. The callable
#  will be called asynchronously if it returns a future, rather than a str. Note
#  that the interface of the spawner class is not deemed stable across versions,
#  so using this functionality might cause your JupyterHub upgrades to break.
#  Default: traitlets.Undefined
# c.Spawner.options_form = traitlets.Undefined

## Interpret HTTP form data
#  
#  Form data will always arrive as a dict of lists of strings. Override this
#  function to understand single-values, numbers, etc.
#  
#  This should coerce form data into the structure expected by self.user_options,
#  which must be a dict, and should be JSON-serializeable, though it can contain
#  bytes in addition to standard JSON data types.
#  
#  This method should not have any side effects. Any handling of `user_options`
#  should be done in `.start()` to ensure consistent behavior across servers
#  spawned via the API and form submission page.
#  
#  Instances will receive this data on self.user_options, after passing through
#  this function, prior to `Spawner.start`.
#  
#  .. versionchanged:: 1.0
#      user_options are persisted in the JupyterHub database to be reused
#      on subsequent spawns if no options are given.
#      user_options is serialized to JSON as part of this persistence
#      (with additional support for bytes in case of uploaded file data),
#      and any non-bytes non-jsonable values will be replaced with None
#      if the user_options are re-used.
#  Default: traitlets.Undefined
# c.Spawner.options_from_form = traitlets.Undefined

## Interval (in seconds) on which to poll the spawner for single-user server's
#  status.
#  
#  At every poll interval, each spawner's `.poll` method is called, which checks
#  if the single-user server is still running. If it isn't running, then
#  JupyterHub modifies its own state accordingly and removes appropriate routes
#  from the configurable proxy.
#  Default: 30
# c.Spawner.poll_interval = 30

## The port for single-user servers to listen on.
#  
#  Defaults to `0`, which uses a randomly allocated port number each time.
#  
#  If set to a non-zero value, all Spawners will use the same port, which only
#  makes sense if each server is on a different address, e.g. in containers.
#  
#  New in version 0.7.
#  Default: 0
# c.Spawner.port = 0

## An optional hook function that you can implement to do work after the spawner
#  stops.
#  
#  This can be set independent of any concrete spawner implementation.
#  Default: None
# c.Spawner.post_stop_hook = None

## An optional hook function that you can implement to do some bootstrapping work
#  before the spawner starts. For example, create a directory for your user or
#  load initial content.
#  
#  This can be set independent of any concrete spawner implementation.
#  
#  This maybe a coroutine.
#  
#  Example::
#  
#      from subprocess import check_call
#      def my_hook(spawner):
#          username = spawner.user.name
#          check_call(['./examples/bootstrap-script/bootstrap.sh', username])
#  
#      c.Spawner.pre_spawn_hook = my_hook
#  Default: None
# c.Spawner.pre_spawn_hook = None

## List of SSL alt names
#  
#          May be set in config if all spawners should have the same value(s),
#          or set at runtime by Spawner that know their names.
#  Default: []
# c.Spawner.ssl_alt_names = []

## Whether to include DNS:localhost, IP:127.0.0.1 in alt names
#  Default: True
# c.Spawner.ssl_alt_names_include_local = True

## Timeout (in seconds) before giving up on starting of single-user server.
#  
#  This is the timeout for start to return, not the timeout for the server to
#  respond. Callers of spawner.start will assume that startup has failed if it
#  takes longer than this. start should return when the server process is started
#  and its location is known.
#  Default: 60
# c.Spawner.start_timeout = 60

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Authenticator(LoggingConfigurable) configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Base class for implementing an authentication provider for JupyterHub

## Set of users that will have admin rights on this JupyterHub.
#  
#  Note: As of JupyterHub 2.0, full admin rights should not be required, and more
#  precise permissions can be managed via roles.
#  
#  Admin users have extra privileges:
#   - Use the admin panel to see list of users logged in
#   - Add / remove users in some authenticators
#   - Restart / halt the hub
#   - Start / stop users' single-user servers
#   - Can access each individual users' single-user server (if configured)
#  
#  Admin access should be treated the same way root access is.
#  
#  Defaults to an empty set, in which case no user has admin access.
#  Default: set()
# c.Authenticator.admin_users = set()

## Set of usernames that are allowed to log in.
#  
#  Use this with supported authenticators to restrict which users can log in.
#  This is an additional list that further restricts users, beyond whatever
#  restrictions the authenticator has in place. Any user in this list is granted
#  the 'user' role on hub startup.
#  
#  If empty, does not perform any additional restriction.
#  
#  .. versionchanged:: 1.2
#      `Authenticator.whitelist` renamed to `allowed_users`
#  Default: set()
# c.Authenticator.allowed_users = set()

## The max age (in seconds) of authentication info
#          before forcing a refresh of user auth info.
#  
#          Refreshing auth info allows, e.g. requesting/re-validating auth
#  tokens.
#  
#          See :meth:`.refresh_user` for what happens when user auth info is refreshed
#          (nothing by default).
#  Default: 300
# c.Authenticator.auth_refresh_age = 300

## Automatically begin the login process
#  
#          rather than starting with a "Login with..." link at `/hub/login`
#  
#          To work, `.login_url()` must give a URL other than the default `/hub/login`,
#          such as an oauth handler or another automatic login handler,
#          registered with `.get_handlers()`.
#  
#          .. versionadded:: 0.8
#  Default: False
# c.Authenticator.auto_login = False

## Automatically begin login process for OAuth2 authorization requests
#  
#  When another application is using JupyterHub as OAuth2 provider, it sends
#  users to `/hub/api/oauth2/authorize`. If the user isn't logged in already, and
#  auto_login is not set, the user will be dumped on the hub's home page, without
#  any context on what to do next.
#  
#  Setting this to true will automatically redirect users to login if they aren't
#  logged in *only* on the `/hub/api/oauth2/authorize` endpoint.
#  
#  .. versionadded:: 1.5
#  Default: False
# c.Authenticator.auto_login_oauth2_authorize = False

## Set of usernames that are not allowed to log in.
#  
#  Use this with supported authenticators to restrict which users can not log in.
#  This is an additional block list that further restricts users, beyond whatever
#  restrictions the authenticator has in place.
#  
#  If empty, does not perform any additional restriction.
#  
#  .. versionadded: 0.9
#  
#  .. versionchanged:: 1.2
#      `Authenticator.blacklist` renamed to `blocked_users`
#  Default: set()
# c.Authenticator.blocked_users = set()

## Delete any users from the database that do not pass validation
#  
#          When JupyterHub starts, `.add_user` will be called
#          on each user in the database to verify that all users are still valid.
#  
#          If `delete_invalid_users` is True,
#          any users that do not pass validation will be deleted from the database.
#          Use this if users might be deleted from an external system,
#          such as local user accounts.
#  
#          If False (default), invalid users remain in the Hub's database
#          and a warning will be issued.
#          This is the default to avoid data loss due to config changes.
#  Default: False
# c.Authenticator.delete_invalid_users = False

## Enable persisting auth_state (if available).
#  
#          auth_state will be encrypted and stored in the Hub's database.
#          This can include things like authentication tokens, etc.
#          to be passed to Spawners as environment variables.
#  
#          Encrypting auth_state requires the cryptography package.
#  
#          Additionally, the JUPYTERHUB_CRYPT_KEY environment variable must
#          contain one (or more, separated by ;) 32B encryption keys.
#          These can be either base64 or hex-encoded.
#  
#          If encryption is unavailable, auth_state cannot be persisted.
#  
#          New in JupyterHub 0.8
#  Default: False
# c.Authenticator.enable_auth_state = False

## Let authenticator manage user groups
#  
#          If True, Authenticator.authenticate and/or .refresh_user
#          may return a list of group names in the 'groups' field,
#          which will be assigned to the user.
#  
#          All group-assignment APIs are disabled if this is True.
#  Default: False
# c.Authenticator.manage_groups = False

## An optional hook function that you can implement to do some bootstrapping work
#  during authentication. For example, loading user account details from an
#  external system.
#  
#  This function is called after the user has passed all authentication checks
#  and is ready to successfully authenticate. This function must return the
#  authentication dict reguardless of changes to it.
#  
#  This maybe a coroutine.
#  
#  .. versionadded: 1.0
#  
#  Example::
#  
#      import os, pwd
#      def my_hook(authenticator, handler, authentication):
#          user_data = pwd.getpwnam(authentication['name'])
#          spawn_data = {
#              'pw_data': user_data
#              'gid_list': os.getgrouplist(authentication['name'], user_data.pw_gid)
#          }
#  
#          if authentication['auth_state'] is None:
#              authentication['auth_state'] = {}
#          authentication['auth_state']['spawn_data'] = spawn_data
#  
#          return authentication
#  
#      c.Authenticator.post_auth_hook = my_hook
#  Default: None
# c.Authenticator.post_auth_hook = None

## Force refresh of auth prior to spawn.
#  
#          This forces :meth:`.refresh_user` to be called prior to launching
#          a server, to ensure that auth state is up-to-date.
#  
#          This can be important when e.g. auth tokens that may have expired
#          are passed to the spawner via environment variables from auth_state.
#  
#          If refresh_user cannot refresh the user auth data,
#          launch will fail until the user logs in again.
#  Default: False
# c.Authenticator.refresh_pre_spawn = False

## Dictionary mapping authenticator usernames to JupyterHub users.
#  
#          Primarily used to normalize OAuth user names to local users.
#  Default: {}
# c.Authenticator.username_map = {}

## Regular expression pattern that all valid usernames must match.
#  
#  If a username does not match the pattern specified here, authentication will
#  not be attempted.
#  
#  If not set, allow any username.
#  Default: ''
# c.Authenticator.username_pattern = ''

## Deprecated, use `Authenticator.allowed_users`
#  Default: set()
# c.Authenticator.whitelist = set()

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CryptKeeper(SingletonConfigurable) configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Encapsulate encryption configuration
#  
#      Use via the encryption_config singleton below.

#  Default: []
# c.CryptKeeper.keys = []

## The number of threads to allocate for encryption
#  Default: 16
# c.CryptKeeper.n_threads = 16
